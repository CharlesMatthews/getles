			<h1>Basic security</h1>
			<h2>Something we've already done</h2>
			<p>Guess what? You already did some steps - we changed a port number. But that's far away from being secure. Well, one can never be secure enough. And honestly, steps explained here wont be enough to make your install bullet-proof. But they will be enough to get you started. I hope you can get some confidence and do stuff by your own after. </p>
                        <p class="warning"> Default usually means "easy to guess". Keep that in mind.</p>
                        <h2>System upgrade</h2>
                        <p> I guess reasoning behind this is pretty simple: outdated software is always risky. To update (or rather upgrade) your Debian login to your VPS and type the code. </p>
                        <p class="code"> apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</p>
                        <p>What we did here is fetching of infos about available packages versions and then upgrade of all installed packages (we connected those 2 steps with &&). Do that often. </p>
                        <h2>Root ain't good</h2>
                        <p>Using root in any way is not good. You should avoid it. </p>
                        <p>How? First we will create new user, that can be used instead of root account.</p>
                        <p class="code">adduser yourname</p>
                        <p>You will be asked to create password and some another questions. Next we need to install <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/sudo" target="_blank">sudo</a>, so we can use our new account instead of root. Sudo is not yet installed, so let's do that first.</p>
                        <p class="code"> apt-get update && apt-get install sudo</p>
                        <p class="warning">It's always good idea to keep repositories updated with apt-get update before installing anything.</p>
                        <p> Sudo allows some users to execute some commands as root. But first it need to be configured by someone who is system administrator, in our case root. You are connected as root, so type following to add your new user to sudoers. <p>
                        <p class="code">adduser yourname sudo</p>
                        <p>Log out from console (little homework, research it if you have not done it, yet) and you should be able to login with your new user. The same way you did with your root account. You might notice the change in your command line. Remember how it looked before? What has changed? </p>
                        <p class="code">yourname@yourserver:~$</p>
                        <p>There is a lot to learn about <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">command line</a>, but I will let you do it by yourself. Also there is a big chance you are already familiar with that stuff. </p>
